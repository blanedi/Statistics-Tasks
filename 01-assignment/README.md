# Analysis of Potential Outcomes and Treatment Effects

This repository contains an analysis of various datasets to understand the effects of different treatments on outcomes. The analysis is conducted using R and is based on the Potential Outcomes Framework.

## Task 1: The Potential Outcomes Framework

- **Objective**: Investigate the effects of coffee consumption on student performance.
- **Conclusion**: The research team overestimated the effect of drinking coffee on students' grades by 4 points, mainly due to the impact of selection bias.

## Task 2: Bringing it all together

- **Objective**: Examine the effects of attending a private high school on students' earnings.
- **Data Source**: `earnings_df.dta`
- **Conclusion**: The research team overestimated the actual effect of attending a private school on students' earnings by 3067.39. The selection bias and differential treatment effect bias played significant roles in this overestimation.

## Task 3: Confounders

- **Objective**: Analyze the relationship between the average weight and daily sleep of pets.
- **Data Source**: `animals_df.csv`
- **Conclusion**: The initial negative relationship between pet weight and sleep hours is confounded by the type of animal. Different animals have biologically different sleep requirements.

## Task 4: Statistics inspired meme

- **Objective**: Create a meme related to the topics covered in the analysis.
- **Output**: A meme stating "Stats assignment - I did it!"
